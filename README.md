# KangarooBuy

This project is a web application for selling pet accessories, developed as part of the TSW (Technologies for Web Services) exam. The main goal was to create a full-featured e-commerce platform where users can browse and purchase various pet-related products, such as collars, toys, and more.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end.
MySQL for the back-end.


üí° Project Background
This project was initially developed as a group assignment, where we mainly used Discord for collaboration and communication. We opted not to use GitHub during the development phase because it was easier to share and test code snippets through Discord with real-time feedback.
